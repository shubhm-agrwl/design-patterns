# Design Patterns:
A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems

# Principals of Design Patterns:
1. Composition over inheritance
2. Code for interface and not implementation

# Classification:
1. Creational - create an object
2. Structural - compose an object
3. Behavioural - communication between objects

# Creational Design Patterns
1. Factory - low coupling, high cohesion
2. Builder
3. Prototype
4. Singleton

# Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter
2. Composite - objects define a tree structure
3. Proxy
4. Facade
5. Decorator
6. Flyweight
7. Bridge

# Behavioural Design Patterns
1. Observer
