# Design Patterns:

# Principals of Design Patterns:

1. Composition over inheritance
2. Code for interface and not implementation

# Classification:

1. Creational - create an object
2. Structural - compose an object
3. Behavioural - communication between objects

# Creational Design Patterns
1. Factory - low coupling, high cohesion
2. Builder
3. Prototype

# Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter
2. Composite - objects define a tree structure

# Behavioural Design Patterns
1. Observer
